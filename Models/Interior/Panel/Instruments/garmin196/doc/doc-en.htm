		<h2>Presentation</h2>
		<p align="justify">
		The Garmin 196 is a GPS receiver to do navigation. It includes land, naval and aerial modes. In the simulated feature, there is only the aerial mode.
		<br/>
		<div align="center">

		</div>
		</p>

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p align="justify">

		To install the Garmin 196, you must declare the nasal in the definition file of the aircraft.
		<pre>
&lt;nasal&gt;
	&lt;garmin196&gt;
		&lt;file&gt;Aircraft/Instruments-3d/garmin196/garmin196.nas&lt;/file&gt;
	&lt;/garmin196&gt;
&lt;/nasal&gt;
		</pre>
		Then declare the xml describing the instrument. Caution, there are two (for now). The first model with the support of Clement OF HAMAIDE (aka F-JJTH)
		<pre>
&lt;!-- Garmin196 --&gt;
&lt;model&gt;
	&lt;path&gt;Aircraft/Instruments-3d/garmin196/garmin196_support1.xml&lt;/path&gt;
	&lt;offsets&gt;
		&lt;x-m&gt;  0.235 &lt;/x-m&gt;
		&lt;y-m&gt;  0.000 &lt;/y-m&gt;
		&lt;z-m&gt;  0.253 &lt;/z-m&gt;
	&lt;/offsets&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
		</pre>
		The coordinates correspond to a facility in the Tecnam 92 ... To install only the Garmin, use the file garmin196.xml (for integration into a panel for example ...). The path (Aircraft/Instruments-3d/garmin196 /) implies that we have installed the directory containing the instrument in Aircraft/Instruments-3d /.

		<h2>Using</h2>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p align="justify">
		<div align="center">
			<img align="center" src="./description.jpg"/>
		</div>
		We have the following elements: 
		<ul>
			<li>A screen where it will display the various screens.</li>
			<li>Buttons (IN, OUT, PAGE, QUIT, ENTER,MENU,NRST,D (the D with a line in the middle, DIRECT TO) and Power (The red button)</li>
			<li>A ROCKER (the button with the four arrows UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT</li>
			<li>An antenna located behind. To rotate the antenna, LMB to rotate in the counterclockwise and clockwise for CMB.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Starting</h3>
		<p align="justify">
		At start of FlightGear, the Garmin is off.
		<br/>
		<div align="center">
			<img align="center" src="./eteint.jpg"/>
		</div>
		To switch on, click the Power button (LMB). The Garmin will display the home page.
		<div align="center">
			<img align="center" src="./startup.jpg"/>
		</div>
		Click Enter to validate the startup (LMB). You are now on the Map Page ... At any time, by clicking Power (CMB) will display the popup of brightness adjustment.
		<div align="center">
			<img align="center" src="./luminosite.jpg"/>
		</div>
		Click on the rocker up or down (LMB) to fit. This brightness is stored when the extinction Gamin (LMB on Power)
		</p>
		
		<h3>Map Page</h3>
		<p align="justify">
			<div align="center">
				<img align="center" src="./mappage.jpg"/>
			</div>
			This screen allows you to view the FlightGear fixed points, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>The airports</li>
				<li>The VOR stations</li>
				<li>The NDB stations</li>
				<li>The FIX points (approachs, airways ...</li>
				<li>Bonus! cities of over 20,000 inhabitants. Yeah, we had to make a choice between the loading time, size of the xml file and readability of the screen ...</li>
			</ul>
			It was also an indication of the north at the top left and bottom right scale. This scale can be changed with the IN and OUT buttons.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Panel Page</h3>
		<p align="justify">
			<div align="center">
				<img align="center" src="./panelpage.jpg"/>
			</div>
			On this screen, we have the following informations :
			<ul>
				<li>Ground speed: beware, this is not the airspeed. With a headwind, you'll feel like going more slowly than the air speed, you risk an overspeed and vice versa in case of wind back, you will go faster than the speed of air and therefore may stall.</li>
				<li>Altitude: The altitude is real, relative to sea level Warning, it does not depend on the atmospheric pressure. It is even less the height from the ground.</li>
				<li>The heading calculated with the displacement : it needs a displacement and therefore speed to calculated this heading</li>
				<li>The CDI : Course Deviation Indicator. When you enter a flight plan, the Garmin display the CDI. It indicate the route between the actual waypoint and the next. You can also see the decalage between your position and this route. When you are in DIRECT TO mode or on the last waypoint, the CDI is aligned with the waypoint bug. You can also see a TO or FROM indicator.
				<li>The VNAV bar : this bar helps you in approach. (Be carreful, the Garmin is not intend to do IFR approach). When a GPS point (an airport only) is selected, the Garmin calculs the ideal glide ratio to target (3 degres) and displays if you are below or above.</li>
				<li>The heading to go to the next waypoint</li>
				<li>Turn rate: the number of degrees per second (5 degrees when the wings are along a small bar). This is not the inclination of the plane.</li>
				<li>The vertical speed</li>
				<li>The identification, distance and time to arrive at the current ground speed. Appears only when a GPS fix has been entered (with a flight plan (Active road) or point (Direct-to)</li>
			</ul>
			
			We move from one screen to another by clicking (LMB) on PAGE or QUIT.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Position Page</h3>
		<p align="justify">
			<div align="center">
				<img align="center" src="./positionpage.jpg"/>
			</div>
			On this screen, we have the following informations:
			<ul>
				<li>A compass display a scrolling banner</li>
				<li>The coordinates of the aircraft position (latitude and longitude)</li>
				<li>The time and date</li>
				<li>Various information (not parameterizable for now)
					<ul>
						<li>The id of the next waypoint</li>
						<li>The time to reach the next waypoint</li>
						<li>The distance of the next waypoint</li>
						<li>The course of the next waypoint (in number and on the compass banner (the grey bar)</li>
						<li>The ground speed</li>
						<li>The altitude</li>
						<li>The heading</li>
						<li>The vertical speed</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Two false informations : batt timer and voltage</li>
				<li>The identification, distance and time to arrive at the current ground speed. Appears only when a GPS fix has been entered (with a flight plan (Active road) or point (Direct-to)</li>
			</ul>
			On Panel Page, Position Page and Map Page, you can enter your current location by clicking ENTER with the middle button of the mouse (CMB).
