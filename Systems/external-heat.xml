<!-- c182s external heater

Accoring to POH (4-33) one should use an external heater below 20°F / -6°C).
The heater is implemented here as simple system:
 - once activated, the heat is applied slowly until reaching a maximum
 - once deactivated, additional heat cools down to 0°F.
 - the calculated difference is then applied as offset to outside-air-temperature and engine oil temperature.
 - these values are used by the priming code in fuel.xml to determine the correct priming value.
