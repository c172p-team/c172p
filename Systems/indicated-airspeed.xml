    IAS Indicated airspeed (IAS) is the airspeed indicator reading(ASIR)
    uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. 
    From current EASA definitions: Indicated airspeed means the speed of
    an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator 
    calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible 
    flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.
    Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is indicated airspeed corrected for
    instrument errors, position error (due to incorrect pressure at the 
    static port) and installation errors.
    According the POH Skyhawk C172P-1982 on Page 5-9 airspeed
    calibration shows a large difference between KIAS and KCAS at lower 
    speeds than 90 and above. 
    It seems this is not reflected by JSBSim or FlightGear in a 
    realistic way.
    So use this numbers and create a table which corrects the
    output shown on the ASI.
